#Servlet-based HTML Form Processing

This repository contains a simple Java Servlet implementation for processing an HTML form. The project demonstrates how to collect user input via an HTML form, send it to a Java Servlet for processing, and display the results back to the user.

Project Overview
The project includes:

An HTML form where users can enter data (e.g., name, email, etc.).
A Java Servlet that processes the form data and returns a response.
A simple structure for validating and displaying the submitted data.

Features

HTML Form: Collects user input through text fields and sends it to the servlet.
Servlet Handling: Processes form data using the POST method and returns the processed data.
Form Validation: Simple validation to ensure the fields are filled out correctly.
Response Display: After the data is processed, a confirmation page is shown displaying the user's input.

Technologies Used

Java Servlet API: For handling HTTP requests and responses.
HTML5: For creating the user input form.
Apache Tomcat: Used as the servlet container for running the application.
